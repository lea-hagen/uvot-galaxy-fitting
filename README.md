This is an SED fitter that combines PEGASE.2 spectral models with a grid of attenuation curve parameters (Av, Rv, 2175A bump).  It uses MCMC, but there is also a chi^2 fitter for quick-look results.

The PEGASE.2 grids (created a long time ago by Erik Hoversten) can be downloaded here:

The code and documentation are in active development.
