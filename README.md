This is an SED fitter that combines PEGASE.2 spectral models with a grid of attenuation curve parameters (Av, Rv, 2175A bump).  It uses MCMC, but there is also a chi^2 fitter for quick-look results.

The PEGASE.2 grids (created a long time ago by Erik Hoversten) can be downloaded here:
<https://stsci.box.com/v/pegase-grids>
They should be placed in ``uvot-galaxy-fitting/uvot-galaxy-fitting/pegase_grids``.

The code and documentation are in active development.  Please consult @lea-hagen before using this.
